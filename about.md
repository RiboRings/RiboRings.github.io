I am a NeuroData student at Jyväskylä University, with a focus on Machine
Learning for Neuroscience. Other than that, I had the chance to work in
metagenomics, microbiome analysis and more generally biological data science,
which ultimately gave me broad and transferable knowledge in scientific
computing, big data analysis and high performance computing. I acquired
international research experience through years of studying and working in
several countries in Europe and beyond. In the future I will focus more on
Neuroscience and Deep Learning.
